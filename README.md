<!-- FUTURE FEATURES -->

## 🔭 Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>


- [ ] **Responsive Design: As more and more users are accessing the web on mobile devices, it's important to ensure that your website looks and works well on all screen sizes. This feature would allow the website to adapt to the screen size of the device it's being viewed on.**
- [ ] **Accessibility: This feature would make the website easy to navigate and use for users with disabilities. This can include things like providing alternative text for images, using semantic HTML tags, and ensuring that the website's contrast ratio is high enough to be easily read by users with low vision.**
- [ ] **CSS preprocessors: CSS preprocessors such as Sass or Less will allow you to use variables, nested selectors, mixins and many other features that can make your CSS code more maintainable and organized. This can help you to write cleaner and more modular CSS code, making it easier to update and maintain.**
